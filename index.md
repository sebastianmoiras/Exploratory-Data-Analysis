ðŸ“Š Global Superstore Analysis

Project Description

This project explores the Global Superstore dataset to uncover insights on sales, profit, discounts, shipping costs, customer segments, product categories, and regional markets.

The main objective is to answer several Business Questions (BQ):
- How do discounts affect profit margins across categories?
- Which customer segments drive the most profit?
- Which global markets are most profitable?
- Which sub-categories are consistently loss-making?
- How do shipping costs relate to order value and profitability?

## Key Insights
### 1.

### 2.

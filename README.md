# Global Superstore Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Global Superstore dataset** to uncover insights related to sales, profit, discounts, shipping costs, customer segments, product categories, and regional markets.  
The main objective is to answer key **Business Questions (BQ)** such as:  
- How do discounts affect profit margins across categories?  
- Which customer segments drive the most profit?  
- Which global markets are most profitable?  
- Which sub-categories are consistently loss-making?  
- How do shipping costs relate to order value and profitability?

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **Discounts above 50%** often lead to **negative profit**, especially in the Furniture category.

- **Corporate customers** provide higher profit margins per order compared to Consumer and Home Office segments.  
- **Technology** drives margins, while **Furniture** suffers from shipping costs.  
- **Tables** are consistently **loss-making**; **Papers** and **Labels** are the strongest profit drivers.  
- **Shipping costs** strongly correlate with sales values, but not always with profitability, high-cost shipments can still generate losses.
